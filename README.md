An executable for viewing [PCD (Point Cloud
Data)](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.php)
files.

The executable colorizes points based on distance from the camera, and
can save the current view along with the camera pose (by hitting the
`f` key) so that posed depth maps may be obtained.
